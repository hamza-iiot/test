The **illusion of thinking** refers to the phenomenon where large language models (LLMs) and reasoning systems **appear to engage in logical or deliberative reasoning** (e.g., by generating step-by-step thought processes) but **do not necessarily achieve better performance** on complex tasks compared to non-thinking models, or may even exhibit **counterintuitive limitations** in their reasoning capabilities. This concept is explored in the context of evaluating models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet (with and without thinking) and DeepSeek (R1 vs. V3) across mathematical and puzzle-based benchmarks. Key observations include:

1. **Comparable Performance on Simpler Tasks**: On benchmarks like **MATH-500**, thinking models show performance comparable to non-thinking models when given the same inference token budget. However, this parity **does not hold for more complex tasks** (e.g., AIME24 and AIME25), where the performance gap widens significantly, suggesting that the "illusion" of enhanced reasoning may not translate to practical advantages in harder problems (the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf, Page 5, Chunk 2).

2. **Overthinking and Collapse Modes**: In tasks like the **Tower of Hanoi**, solution accuracy increases with thinking progression up to a certain complexity threshold but **collapses to zero beyond that point**, even when the model is provided with the correct algorithm. Simpler problems may also show **decreased accuracy** as thinking progresses, indicating **overthinking** or inefficiencies in reasoning (the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf, Page 10, Chunk 6).

3. **Inconsistencies in Reasoning Expression**: Studies (e.g., Schulman et al.) suggest that models may **not always express their thoughts accurately**, implying that the presence of a "thinking" process does not guarantee correctness or reliability in problem-solving (the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf, Page 14, Chunk 7).

In essence, the "illusion of thinking" highlights the **disconnect between the appearance of reasoning** (e.g., verbose thought processes) and **actual problem-solving effectiveness**, particularly under conditions of high complexity or specific constraints. This challenges the assumption that explicit reasoning mechanisms inherently improve performance and underscores the need for further investigation into the limitations of current models.
