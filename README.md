Based on the context provided, the **approximate investment required** and **potential savings** from implementing the improvements can be estimated as follows. Note that exact figures are not explicitly stated in the context, but we can infer approximate values based on the described projects and their financial implications.

### **1. Investment Required (CAPEX and OPEX)**
The total investment depends on the scope of improvements. Key components include:

#### **A. Infrastructure Upgrades**
- **Seawater Intake Pipeline Replacement:** **SAR 1.75 million** (to prevent plant failure)
- **Valve, Flange, and Gasket Replacements:** **SAR 1.08 million** (to address corrosion)
- **Pump System Upgrades:**
  - **High-Pressure Pumps:** SAR 100,000 (HP Flanges/Gaskets) + SAR 520,000 (valves) = **SAR 620,000** (Context 1, Page 54)
  - **Alternative Estimate:** SAR 80,000 (HP Flanges/Gaskets) + SAR 500,000 (valves) = **SAR 580,000** (Context 4, Page 56)
- **ERD System Replacements:**
  - **ERD PX-Q300 Modules:** **SAR 1.2 million** (5 units)
  - **ERD Rotor Sleeves:** **SAR 675,000** (5 units)
- **Chemical Optimization:** Minimal CAPEX (e.g., Jar tests, calibration equipment) – **SAR 50,000–100,000**
- **Personnel/Process Optimization:** Minimal CAPEX (e.g., automation, training) – **SAR 200,000–500,000**

**Total Estimated Investment (CAPEX):**
- **Minimum Estimate:** SAR 1.75M + 1.08M + 580K + 1.2M + 675K + 50K + 200K = **SAR 5.36 million**
- **Maximum Estimate:** SAR 1.75M + 1.08M + 620K + 1.2M + 675K + 100K + 500K = **SAR 5.425 million**

#### **B. Operational Expenditures (OPEX)**
- **Chemical Optimization:** Savings from reduced chemical usage (e.g., antiscalant, coagulants) could reduce OPEX by **SAR 100,000–300,000 annually**.
- **Maintenance Savings:** Improved maintenance strategies (e.g., preventive care) could reduce unplanned downtime and repair costs by **SAR 200,000–500,000 annually**.
- **Personnel Efficiency:** Streamlining processes or automation could reduce labor costs by **SAR 100,000–200,000 annually**.

**Total Estimated OPEX Savings (Annual):** **SAR 400,000–1 million**

### **2. Approximate Savings on Production Costs**
The savings depend on the success of the improvements in reducing downtime, maintenance costs, and operational inefficiencies. Key estimates:

#### **A. Avoided Downtime and Repairs**
- **Seawater Intake Pipeline:** Preventing catastrophic failure could save **SAR 500,000–1 million annually** in lost production and emergency repairs.
- **ERD System Replacements:** Avoiding ERD module failures could save **SAR 300,000–600,000 annually** in downtime and reduced efficiency.

#### **B. Chemical and Energy Efficiency**
- **Chemical Optimization:** Savings from reduced chemical usage and membrane fouling: **SAR 100,000–300,000 annually**.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Optimizing pump operations and part-load efficiency could reduce energy costs by **SAR 150,000–300,000 annually**.

#### **C. Long-Term Equipment Lifespan**
- **Extended Equipment Life:** Replacing worn components (e.g., valves, ERD modules) could extend equipment lifespan by **5–10 years**, reducing replacement costs over time.

**Total Estimated Annual Savings (Production Cost Reduction):**
- **Minimum Estimate:** SAR 500,000 (downtime) + 300,000 (chemical) + 150,000 (energy) = **SAR 950,000**
- **Maximum Estimate:** SAR 1M (downtime) + 300,000 (chemical) + 300,000 (energy) = **SAR 1.6 million**

### **Key Notes**
1. **ROI Timeline:** The investment is expected to pay off within **3–5 years** through reduced downtime, maintenance costs, and operational efficiency.
2. **Uncertainties:** Savings depend on factors like maintenance adherence, chemical optimization success, and equipment longevity.
3. **Additional Benefits:** Improved reliability and compliance with safety/environmental standards (e.g., QHSE policies) may also reduce long-term risks.

This is a **high-level approximation** based on the context. For precise figures, a detailed cost-benefit analysis and engineering study would be required.
