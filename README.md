### **1. Investment Required (CAPEX and OPEX)**
The total investment depends on the scope of improvements. Key components include:

#### **A. Infrastructure Upgrades**
- **Seawater Intake Pipeline Replacement:** **SAR 1.75 million** (to prevent plant failure)
- **Valve, Flange, and Gasket Replacements:** **SAR 1.08 million** (to address corrosion)
- **Pump System Upgrades:**
  - **High-Pressure Pumps:** SAR 100,000 (HP Flanges/Gaskets) + SAR 520,000 (valves) = **SAR 620,000** (Context 1, Page 54)
  - **Alternative Estimate:** SAR 80,000 (HP Flanges/Gaskets) + SAR 500,000 (valves) = **SAR 580,000** (Context 4, Page 56)
- **ERD System Replacements:**
  - **ERD PX-Q300 Modules:** **SAR 1.2 million** (5 units)
  - **ERD Rotor Sleeves:** **SAR 675,000** (5 units)
- **Chemical Optimization:** Minimal CAPEX (e.g., Jar tests, calibration equipment) – **SAR 50,000–100,000**
- **Personnel/Process Optimization:** Minimal CAPEX (e.g., automation, training) – **SAR 200,000–500,000**

**Total Estimated Investment (CAPEX):**
- **Minimum Estimate:** SAR 1.75M + 1.08M + 580K + 1.2M + 675K + 50K + 200K = **SAR 5.36 million**
- **Maximum Estimate:** SAR 1.75M + 1.08M + 620K + 1.2M + 675K + 100K + 500K = **SAR 5.425 million**

#### **B. Operational Expenditures (OPEX)**
- **Chemical Optimization:** Savings from reduced chemical usage (e.g., antiscalant, coagulants) could reduce OPEX by **SAR 100,000–300,000 annually**.
- **Maintenance Savings:** Improved maintenance strategies (e.g., preventive care) could reduce unplanned downtime and repair costs by **SAR 200,000–500,000 annually**.
- **Personnel Efficiency:** Streamlining processes or automation could reduce labor costs by **SAR 100,000–200,000 annually**.

**Total Estimated OPEX Savings (Annual):** **SAR 400,000–1 million**

### **2. Approximate Savings on Production Costs**
The savings depend on the success of the improvements in reducing downtime, maintenance costs, and operational inefficiencies. Key estimates:

#### **A. Avoided Downtime and Repairs**
- **Seawater Intake Pipeline:** Preventing catastrophic failure could save **SAR 500,000–1 million annually** in lost production and emergency repairs.
- **ERD System Replacements:** Avoiding ERD module failures could save **SAR 300,000–600,000 annually** in downtime and reduced efficiency.

#### **B. Chemical and Energy Efficiency**
- **Chemical Optimization:** Savings from reduced chemical usage and membrane fouling: **SAR 100,000–300,000 annually**.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Optimizing pump operations and part-load efficiency could reduce energy costs by **SAR 150,000–300,000 annually**.

#### **C. Long-Term Equipment Lifespan**
- **Extended Equipment Life:** Replacing worn components (e.g., valves, ERD modules) could extend equipment lifespan by **5–10 years**, reducing replacement costs over time.

**Total Estimated Annual Savings (Production Cost Reduction):**
- **Minimum Estimate:** SAR 500,000 (downtime) + 300,000 (chemical) + 150,000 (energy) = **SAR 950,000**
- **Maximum Estimate:** SAR 1M (downtime) + 300,000 (chemical) + 300,000 (energy) = **SAR 1.6 million**

### **Key Notes**
1. **ROI Timeline:** The investment is expected to pay off within **3–5 years** through reduced downtime, maintenance costs, and operational efficiency.
2. **Uncertainties:** Savings depend on factors like maintenance adherence, chemical optimization success, and equipment longevity.
3. **Additional Benefits:** Improved reliability and compliance with safety/environmental standards (e.g., QHSE policies) may also reduce long-term risks.

This is a **high-level approximation** based on the context. For precise figures, a detailed cost-benefit analysis and engineering study would be required.
